  INSTALLATION

    Start the same way as width any other Zikula module:

    1) Copy the files into Zikula's /modules directory.

    2) Go to Zikula's module admin page and regenerate the list.

    3) Install and activate the Mediashare module.

    4) Try to create a new album - if it fails with the message
       "calling mediashareUpdateNestedSetValues() failed" then you probably have
       MySQL version 4.x - and Mediashare works best with MySQL 5.x. To fix this,
       open file pneditapi.php and search for "MySQL switch" and then 
       change (true) to (false).

    If you are using short URLs then you may have to add the line below to your 
    .htaccess file. This ensures media files are found in the right place.

    RewriteRule ^mediashare/.*/mediashare/(.+) mediashare/$1


  UNINSTALL

    First, uninstall Mediashare like any other Zikula module.
    Then manually delete all media files from the "mediashare" directory.


  CONFIGURATION

    1) Decide if you want to store media files on the local file system or in 
       the database.

       Normal user should store files in the local file system. This is much
       faster but slightly less secure. If you really need 100% bullet proof
       access control then store files in the database (see the section on
       security).

       Storing files in the database can make backup easier (no need to backup any
       thing else than the database) and it may be the only way to setup Mediashare
       on multiple web servers using the same database. But it slows down performance
       considerably.

    1.1) Files on the local file system

         Create a upload directory and configure it in the Mediashare admin panel. Make
         sure this directory is writable by the webserver. This will be the place for
         all the files that you upload.

         For SAFE_MODE reasons you may have to set the GID or UID bits on this 
         directory. Don't ask me why - but my webserver didn't work without.

         Go to Mediashare's admin page and write the full path to this directory as
         the "Media upload dir.".

    1.2) Files in the database

         Add this line to your .htaccess file:

         RewriteRule ^mediashare/(vfsdb/[a-z0-9]+-[a-z]+\.[a-z]+)$ index.php?module=mediashare&type=vfs_db&func=dump&ref=$1 [PT]

         This converts /mediashare/vfsdb/xxxx file references to a Zikula 
         function call for Mediashare.

    2) Make sure the "Temporary dir." points to a writable directory. This 
       directory will be used by Mediashare when converting and resizing media 
       files.
