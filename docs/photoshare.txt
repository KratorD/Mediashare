  IMPORTING FROM PHOTOSHARE

    You can import from Photoshare and remove Photoshare's copy of all 
    images while still keeping the old URLs alive. Medishare will create a 
    table that maps from Photoshare image URLs to Mediashare URLs.

    1) Go to Mediashare's admin page and follow the import instructions. 
       Albums are imported in alphabetical order. If the import fails, you will 
       need to remove the file or album causing the problem - the next to be 
       imported.

    2) Backup Photoshare, it's datafiles, and the database.

    3) Do NOT remove or deactivate the Photoshare module from the admin 
       panel. Simply replace the file "photoshare/pnshow.php" with the new copy 
       in "mediashare/photoshare/pnshow.php"

    4) You can now remove Photoshare's image directory (if the images were 
       stored in the file system) or the images from the Photoshare tables 
       within the Zikula database. From your preferred database management 
       tool, you can remove the (prefix)_photoshare_images table, remove the 
       pn_imagedata and pn_thumbnaildata. If you are using MySQL's command 
       line, you need to "alter table (prefix)_photoshare_images drop column 
       pn_imagedata;" then "alter table (prefix)_photoshare_images drop column 
       pn_thumbnaildata;".
