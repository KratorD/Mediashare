  USAGE

    The very short guide is: 
    - Create albums and start uploading media files into these.
    - Browse albums and view their images in slideshows.

    The album browsing URL is:
    http://somewhere/index.php?module=mediashare

    The editing URL is:
    http://somewhere/index.php?module=Mediashare&type=edit&func=view&aid=1

    Image URLs are:
    http://somewhere/mediashare/xxx

    Where xxx is a random identifier (see the security chapter below)

    You can also use {mediashare} in Zikula's menu
    this leads to the top album.


  USING WITH GALLERY REMOTE

    The Menalto Gallery project has a Java based image uploader which can be used
    together with Mediashare (tested with Gallery Remote 1.5). You can download 
    the uploader here:

    http://gallery.menalto.com/wiki/Gallery_Remote


    Install the uploader on your local machine and start it. First thing to do is
    to add a URL for your Mediashare interface. USE THE STANDALONE GALLERY TYPE!
    The URL is:

    http://YOURHOST/index.php?module=mediashare&type=remote&func=main&

    BE VERY CAREFULL TO REMEMBER THE LAST AMPERSAND!

    Now you are ready to go. That was easy :-)

    This interface can probably also be used with some of the Gallery screensaver
    programs (untested).
