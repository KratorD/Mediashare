  MEDIASHARE CUSTOMIZATION

    TEMPLATES
    You can modify the looks by adding your own theme specific templates (as with
    any other pnRender based module).

    Just copy any of the files from /modules/mediashare/pntemplates/* to 
    /themes/YourTheme/templates/modules/mediashare/* or
    /config/templates/mediashare/* and edit the copies.

    TEMPLATE SETS
    The album viewer, thumbnail list, and the slideshow viewer supports templates 
    selected by album. The templates can be located in:
    /config/templates/mediashare/Frontend/TemplateSet/*.html

    Add your own "TemplateSet" directory and place any of the following files in it:
      album.html      - album viewer template
      item.html       - media item template
      thumbnails.html - thumbnail viewer template
      slideshow.html  - slideshow template


  SCRIPTACULOUS AND LIGHTBOX SCRIPTS

    Mediashare ships with it's own copy of the lightbox script used for the cool
    image viewer effects. If you want to use another instance of the library then
    copy the template "mediashare_include_lightbox.html" to your theme template
    directory and modify it to suit your needs.
