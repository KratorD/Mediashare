  INTEGRATING MEDIASHARE WITH OTHER MODULES

    In order to use Mediashare's media item selector from other modules you must
    do the following:

    1) Make sure the "mediashare/pnjavascript/finditem.js" JavaScript file is
       included in the web page from which the media selector is opened. This 
       script supplies a function named "mediashareFindItem" which opens the media
       selector window when called.

       Example:
       <script type="text/javascript" src="modules/mediashare/pnjavascript/finditem.js"></script>

    2) Specify an HTML "id" attribute on the input element that Mediashare should
       paste the media tag or URL into. The actual ID is up to you. The input
       element may either be a text input or a textarea element (even works with
       the Xinha/HtmlArea editor).

       Examples:
       <textarea id="articleTextarea"></textarea>
       <input type="text" id="mediaURL"/>

    3) Add a button (or other clickable element) with an "onclick" handler that
       calls mediashareFindItem(inputId, selectorURL). The "inputId" parameter 
       holds the ID of the input from step (2). The selector URL holds the URL to
       Mediashare's media selector window. You can get this URL from PHP/Zikula
       by calling:

       pnModUrl('mediashare', 'external', 'finditem', 
                array('url'  => 'relative',
                      'mode' => 'url'));

       or

       pnModUrl('mediashare', 'external', 'finditem', 
                array('url'  => 'relative',
                      'mode' => 'html'));

     The "url" and "mode" arguments specifies how the media selector should paste
     the result back into the external input. If "url" is "relative" then only
     the relative part of the media URL is pasted - otherwise the full absolute
     path is used. If "mode" is "html" then a complete media tag is pasted, 
     otherwise only the URL is pasted.

     In addition to "url" and "mode" you can set "onlymine=1" which will restrict
     the selection to albums of the current user.

     Example:
     <input type="button" value="Insert media item" 
            onclick="mediashareFindItem('articleTextarea', 'http://...&url=relative&mode=html')">

    4) Make sure to include the following on the pages that contains medias:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="modules/mediashare/pnjavascript/view.js"></script>

    This ensure Mediashare's popup windows works.


    Mediashare does also have a media item selector for pnForms in Zikula.
